Follow the flow of execution in the following programs and predict what will happen for each
one
---------------------------------------
Example 1
---------------------------------------
a = input("What... is your quest")
b = "to seek the holy grail"
if a != b:
    print("Go On. Off you go")
else:
    b = input("What...is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?")
    if b == "What do you mean? An African or European swallow?":
        print("I don't know that...AHHH [Bridgekeeper was thrown over bridge]")
    else:
        print("[you were thrown over bridge]")

Prediction: Either you go on, the bridgekeeper gets thrown over the bridge, or you get thrown over the bridge.
Actual: Go on. Off you go.

---------------------------------------
Example 2
---------------------------------------
user_input = input("What is your favorite color")
if user_input == 'blue':
    print("Blueskadoo")
elif user_input == "red":
    print("Roses are red!")
elif user_input == "yellow":
    print("Mellow Yellow")
elif user_input == "green":
    print("Green Machine")
elif user_input == "orange":
    print("Orange you glad I didn't say banana.")
elif user_input == "black":
    print("I see a red door and I want it painted black")
elif user_input == "purple":
    print("And we'll never be royalllssss")
elif user_input == "pink":
    print("Pinky- and the Brain")
else:
    print("I don't recognize that color. Is it even...??")

Prediction: Something different is said for each color that is inputted in.
