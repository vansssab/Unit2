1. In your Notebook
-------------------
Answer the following
    1.  How would you print out something 10 times? What about 100? What about 1,000?
while x < 11, while x < 101 , while x < 1001
    2.  Can you remember something from Snap! that might allow that?
the repeat block 
2. Open up the console
----------------------
Type the following code using interactive mode:
while True:
    print('a')

3. In your Notebook
-------------------
Write responses for the following:
    1.  What happens when you run this code?
it prints a repeatedly/ forever
Try using other Boolean expressions instead of True (e.g. 4 > 5 and 9 != 2), and explore what happens.

    2.  How would you print out something 10 times? What about 100? What about 1,000?
while x < 11, while x < 101 , while x < 1001
4.  Consider the following code and predict what it will do, then see what it actually does:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
n = 3
while n > 0:
    print(n)
    n = n-1
print('Blastoff!')

** you will need to run this in script mode or get an error

prediction: countdown then say blastoff
actual: countdown then say blastoff

5. In script mode...
--------------------
Type and run the following code:

great_pets = ['cat', 'dog']
while True:
    animal = input("What is your favorite pet? ")
    if animal == 'quit':
        print("Bye!")
        break
    else:
        if animal in great_pets:
            print("A great pet!")
        else:
            print(f"{animal}, a fine pet!")
